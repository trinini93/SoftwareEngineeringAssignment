<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    I am an aspiring software developer who is a graduate of Grand Circus's Java Bootcamp. Prior to the bootcamp, I
    worked as a Sales Account Executive at a mortgage company in Metro Detroit. What sparked my interest in the
    technology field is realizing that it will always be a thriving industry with many opportunities to learn and grow -
    two of which are some of my most important core values.</p>

<p>
    When I'm not practicing code, I can be found enjoying a good book, hiking/being outdoors, or playing with my
    3-year-old Siberian Husky, Lupin (who happens to named after Professor Lupin from Harry Potter!).</p>

<p>
    I am seeking a junior software developer position with Hello World, Inc where I can utilize and share my newly
    acquired programming knowledge, as well as be mentored by senior developers and team members to play my part in meeting company goals.
    Please feel free to check out my GitHub projects as well as get in touch with me via LinkedIn, email, or phone at 313-920-6536.</p>
